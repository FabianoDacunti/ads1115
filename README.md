## Library for ADS1115 (Analog to Digital Converter)

## Description

This library offers functionalities and data structures to simplify communication, control, and interaction with the ADS1115 (Analog-to-Digital Converter). These reusable components are intended for integration into software embedded in various architectures.

The ADS1115 is a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter produced by Texas Instruments. It features four input channels (differential, single-ended), and operates at sampling rates of up to 860 samples per second. The device includes an internal programmable gain amplifier (PGA) as well as an I2C communication interface for ease of use.
